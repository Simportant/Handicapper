Clause 23 of the CONGU Unified Handicapping System covers the "Annual Review" of handicaps (these should be completed by all clubs for all members) and it gives guidance on "General Play" adjustments. 

Clubs can apply a "General Play" adjustment to a non-category 1 golfer's handicap if it is felt to be too high or low, and not representative of current playing ability. It basically allows clubs to protect against "bandits", and to re-set handicaps of those who can no longer be competitive because of poor health or advancing age.

The handicap committee has to possess sound evidence to make a downward change, but it can be considered given the following circumstances: 

(1) When a player is returning poor scores in handicap qualifying competitions but is enjoying consistent success in match-play and better ball events. 
(2) When a player is obviously improving and is consistently returning scores below handicap.
